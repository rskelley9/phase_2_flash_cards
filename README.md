phase_2_flash_cards
===================

A web flashcards application, written with the Sinatra framework.

The first project assigned in DBC's Phase-2, this web flaschards application was created in 2 1/2 days. 

The application authenticates users and routes them to their personal profile page where they can view their past performance, 

or simply click a clink and start a new flashcards quiz. Users scroll through flashcards, and type in answers which are then matched

with those in the database to determine correctness. Users are given feedback for their answers.
